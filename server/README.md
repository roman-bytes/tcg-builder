# POKEMON PICK 6 SERVER

This is a go server that uses the [PokemonTCG SDK](https://github.com/PokemonTCG/pokemon-tcg-sdk-go-v2) to fetch a random card from the Pokemon TCG API.

You will need to set the `POKEMON_API_KEY` environment variable to your Pokemon TCG API key. Sign up for a free API key [here](https://pokemontcg.io/).

You can run the server using `go run main.go`
